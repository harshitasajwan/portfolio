    <h2>About Harshita</h2>
    <pre>
        I'm Harshita Sajwan, currently pursuing  B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering at <a href ="https://www.ipec.org.in/" target="_blank" style="color: #9333ea;" onmousedown="this.style.color='#9333ea'" onmouseup="this.style.color='#9333ea'"><strong>Inderprastha Engineering College</strong></a>, Ghaziabad. I completed my schooling at <a href ="https://www.ladyirwinschool.org/" target="_blank" style="color: #9333ea;" onmousedown="this.style.color='#9333ea'" onmouseup="this.style.color='#9333ea'"><strong>Lady Irwin Senior Secondary School</strong></a> in New Delhi. Although I originally hail from Uttarakhand, I was born and raised in Delhi, which has helped shape my perspective on blending tradition with modernity.
        As a tech enthusiast, I've always been fascinated by how technology influences and shapes the world around us. This curiosity motivates me to explore various areas within the tech industry, from software development to problem-solving through code. I approach challenges with a fearless attitude, always eager to take on new tasks and projects that expand my knowledge.
        I pride myself on being hardworking and detail-oriented, balancing both collaborative and independent work. Whether it's building an app, solving algorithms, or experimenting with new tools, I enjoy tackling complex problems and finding creative solutions.
        My journey in the tech world has just begun, and I am excited to continue growing as a developer and making a positive impact on the industry.
